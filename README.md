I always forget my password and found myself to keep resetting password.

Making this as I want to have a fun project to do and also helping to keep track of my password.

Email address is used to forget master password

Master password is salted and hashed with Java own built-in hashed algorithm .hashcode()

TODO:
Try to hide all stored passwords by default
One tap to reveal passwords
Long tap to remove passwords

Current worries:
Learnt that map only holds unique key
Best practices for Java programming
